# HeikoDiscoPi
HeikoDiscoPy is a Raspberry Pi “Disco Mode” trigger that listens to a wired emergency button on GPIO and, on press, turns on an IKEA Zigbee power outlet (“fuse”) via a Zigbee USB dongle and plays a random audio track until it ends. It supports USB-stick hot-plug (auto-mount + on-the-fly media discovery).
